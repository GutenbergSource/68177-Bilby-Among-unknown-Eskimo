<HTML><BODY>This 1923 book is about the authors life with the Inuit living on and around
Baffin Bay, between Baffin Island and Greenland, which should more properly be called a sea. The word Eskimo, which is derived from an Indian word for
"raw flesh eater" (Usquemow, see p. 56 of this work) is now considered derogatory, but at the time this 
book was written, it didn't have that connotation.

<p>The text is not difficult, so have fun!
